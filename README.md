A Movie and TV Shows database and API \
Please visit the website on : [SudahNonton-API](https://sudahnonton.000webhostapp.com/)

## Description
This is a project for my own amusement. I love watching movies and tv shows. But I tend to forget, whether I have watched the show or not. So using Laravel 8, I created the database website. This web also serves as API provider, so I can consume the data using other data that I created next. The design is based on the Netflix website design\
All the data is thanks to [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
