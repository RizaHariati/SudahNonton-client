# SudahNonton-Client

A Movie and TV Shows database Android Phone App \
Using Expo App please check my App on : [SudahNonton-Client](https://expo.dev/@rizahariati/sudahnonton-client)

## Description
I watched so many movies and tv shows over the years, so when I'm going to watch a new show, I want to check whether I've already watched it or not. That's what this app is for. With my phone, I can check anywhere, anytime, all of those shows. By accessing the database from the Rest API that I've created earlier.
I can also add a new show, put it on my watch list, if I want to watch it again. 
Other users can also use this app if they are looking for ideas of what movies or tv shows they are going to watch next\
All the data is thanks to [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
